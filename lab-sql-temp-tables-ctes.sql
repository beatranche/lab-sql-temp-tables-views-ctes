-- Challenge
-- Creating a Customer Summary Report

-- In this exercise, you will create a customer summary report that summarizes key information about customers in the Sakila database, 
-- including their rental history and payment details. The report will be generated using a combination of views, CTEs, and temporary tables.

-- Step 1: Create a View
-- First, create a view that summarizes rental information for each customer. The view should include 
-- the customer's ID, name, email address, and total number of rentals (rental_count).
CREATE VIEW customer_rental_summary AS
SELECT
    c.customer_id,
    CONCAT(c.first_name, ' ', c.last_name) AS customer_name,
    c.email,
    COUNT(r.rental_id) AS rental_count
FROM
    customer c
JOIN
    rental r ON c.customer_id = r.customer_id
GROUP BY
    c.customer_id, c.first_name, c.last_name, c.email;

select * from customer_rental_summary;

-- Step 2: Create a Temporary Table
-- Next, create a Temporary Table that calculates the total amount paid by each customer (total_paid). 
-- The Temporary Table should use the rental summary view created in Step 1 to join with the payment table and calculate the total amount paid by each customer.

CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE customer_payment_summary AS
SELECT
    crs.customer_id,
    crs.customer_name,
    crs.email,
    crs.rental_count,
    SUM(p.amount) AS total_paid
FROM
    customer_rental_summary crs
JOIN
    payment p ON crs.customer_id = p.customer_id
GROUP BY
    crs.customer_id, crs.customer_name, crs.email, crs.rental_count;
    
select * from customer_payment_summary;

-- Step 3: Create a CTE and the Customer Summary Report
-- Create a CTE that joins the rental summary View with the customer payment summary Temporary Table created in Step 2. 
-- The CTE should include the customer's name, email address, rental count, and total amount paid.
-- Next, using the CTE, create the query to generate the final customer summary report, which should include: 
-- customer name, email, rental_count, total_paid and average_payment_per_rental, this last column is a derived column from total_paid and rental_count.

WITH customer_summary_cte AS (
    SELECT
        crs.customer_id,
        crs.customer_name,
        crs.email,
        crs.rental_count,
        cps.total_paid
    FROM
        customer_rental_summary crs
    JOIN
        customer_payment_summary cps ON crs.customer_id = cps.customer_id
)

SELECT
    customer_id,
    customer_name,
    email,
    rental_count,
    total_paid
FROM
    customer_summary_cte;
